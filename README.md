# Parking-App-Figma-Prototype
This is A Parking App Figma Prototype Project I built and designed for a University Assignment Submission in 2nd Year
# INSTRUCTIONS
<br>
For this assessment, you will plan and carry out a UX research and design process in response to a
problem statement.
The end result of your design activities must be a high-fidelity Figma prototype, however you are
required to show evidence of the iterative design process you have followed to reach that goal.
You are required to deliver the following:
• A Proto-Persona and an Empathy Map (each with a maximum of 400 words). <br>
• Evidence of iterative development, through annotated low-fidelity prototypes (each with a 
maximum of 20 screens). <br>
• Results of any user testing you have carried out and evidence of how that supported the
refinement of your design. <br>
• A high-fidelity prototype for the problem statement described below. <br>
• A video (approx. 5 minutes) explaining the process you followed and showcasing the final
high-fidelity prototype features.

# Problem Statement <br>
The company you work for has been contracted by the local City Council to design a mobile app.
The purpose of the app is to enable visitors to the city’s shopping centres and amenities to pay the
extortionate parking charges at any of the council-owned car parks in the city.<br>
It is known that some older drivers struggle with modern methods of payment (such as contactless
and apps), however this demographic is an important source of visitors to the city.<br>
While some other cities have recently put in place alternative payment arrangements (e.g. St Albans –
see https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwypzwe0ex7o) your own City Council are determined that
their app will be so “user friendly” (in their words!) that all visitors will find it straightforward to use.
Your task, therefore, is to design a mobile app which provides the following features: <br>
• An interface which is both visually appealing and intuitive to use <br>
• Is accessible especially for older visitors to the city <br>
• Allows users to pay for parking for <br>
o a specified length of time <br>
o starting at a specified time/date <br>
o in a specified council car park or other designated parking area <br>
• Gives users the option to pay for parking in advance <br>
• Integrates with the phone’s location sensor to allow users to pay for parking “on the spot” 
wherever and whenever they park in the city. <br>
• Allows users to see their parking history and receipts of payments made v
• Can be set to give reminders when time is running out <br>
• Allows regular users to create a profile including <br>
